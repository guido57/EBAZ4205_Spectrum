# EBAZ4205_SDR

## Description

This repository contains the Vivado project, the Vitis project and a Python app to display the 0-32 MHz radio spectrum.

## Getting Started for FPGA or EBAZ4205 beginner

Before going straight to this project, I strongly reccomend to carefully prepare your HW / SW environment, following the instructions contained in:
* [HW is in my Cheap (35$) and powerful FPGA Programming Hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/187351-cheap-35-and-powerful-fpga-programming)
* [SW is in my EBAZ4205 repository](https://github.com/guido57/EBAZ4205)

There's nothing esoteric in it, but this project is quite complex because it requires: 
* Hardware assembling (you can use a solder iron on SMD, don't you?) 
* FPGA Zynq7010 design and programming with Xilinx Vivado 
* flashing Linux on the Zynq7010 FPGA with Xilinx Petalinux
* building a C++ program running on Linux
* building a Python program on Windows

## Getting Started

* [HW is in my 30 MHz Spectrum and SDR in a FPGA Hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/186329-30mhz-spectrum-and-sdr-in-a-fpga)
* SW is here :) 

## Software
